# LootBox

> **Work in progress** — actively being developed. Features may change, break, or disappear.

**Your shipments, unboxed.** A self-hosted shipping dashboard that scans your Gmail, extracts tracking info, and gives you one clean view of everything headed your way.

No more digging through emails. No more "did I already order that?" Just open LootBox and see what's coming.

## What it does

- **Gmail sync** — Connects via OAuth2 and automatically finds shipping/order confirmation emails
- **Smart parsing** — Extracts carriers, tracking numbers, product names, and images from 10+ carrier formats (FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, Amazon, AliExpress, and more)
- **Live dashboard** — See all your shipments at a glance with status, carrier, ETA, and product images
- **Detail view** — Tap any shipment for the full timeline: order date, tracking events, original email
- **Flag & review** — Flag suspicious or interesting shipments with multi-select reasons and notes
- **Research export** — Export flagged items for further investigation
- **Password protected** — Simple family-friendly password gate keeps it private
- **Dark mode** — Because obviously
